# giphy-api

This app uses the Giphy API to get gifs about preselect cities of Europe like Manchester, London, Madrid, Rome, Berlin and with the option to add more cities. In order to add another city you need to specify the country to do a better query to look for appropriate gifs from the city.  After you click the button of the city you will see 10 random gifs found that contain the name of the city and the country. If you click on a gif it will start playing and if you click again it will stop.
